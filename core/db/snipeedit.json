    ". One that remains oblivious to what Alex knows to be what must be done. She has participated in many exchanges of will in this realm. Preferably she would not have to resort to this. But that is not the reality of this realm. The will of the realm itself is more powerful then any being that attempts to lay claim to it. Alex herself has tried to do so in her time in this realm. She found herself unable to triumph over the much stronger will of the realm. 'Steve?' would likely not be one to attempt such a tactic. If the positions of her and the equal one were reversed she would call this struggle foolish. But that is not the case, and as such she does not need to address the hypocrisy of the situation. Alex knows that her and the equal one are different. The proof is in the fact that her and 'Steve?' are not one. His approach to his encounters with the wills of others is bizarre to her. This passive idealism is the opposite of Alex's active pessimism. She knows that she will be unable to comprehend his motives. For she is unwilling to put herself in 'Steve?'s shoes. Alex will not let this upset her any more. She tires of concerning herself with the equal one. The threat of his potential has been eliminated in her mind. This being will not oppose Alex for he does not see reality as she does. The difference would alert her for another being, but this aspect of 'Steve?' reaffirms her conclusion. Without a word Alex walks out of the room. She has more important places to be in a moment besides this one. She does not concern herself with the equal one as she walks away. Whatever his goals may be at this moment will not be her concern in the next.",
